			<p>My name is Dzemal Malagic and I was born and raised in Midtown Manhattan, best place in the city. I'm originally from Bosnia and Montenegro, countries that a lot of people can't even find on a map but they're absolutely beautiful! I go back and visit my family every summer and while I'm over there, I try to travel to as many different countries as I can. After my experiences in Europe, I can definitely see myself moving over there when I'm older, mainly because of the culture. Everyone's so much more relaxed over there than they are here.<p>
			<p>I graduated from hunter College in 2012 with a Bachelor's degree in Economics which I wasn't too fond of.I worked in Finance for a little over a year and I absolutely hated it. I always had this vision in my head that I would learn to love my job after looking at my paychecks but I realized money wasn't everything. I read a random article one day on Computer Programming and it just hit me, this is what I wanted to do. I immediately applied to a few schools and I was eventually accepted into the New York Code + Design Academy and I couldn't be happier with my decision to switch fields. It's pretty hectic having a bunch of different concepts thrown at us at the same time but I love being challenged mentally.</p>
